    "Say you need to plan a given trajectory for your *dynamical system*. This system is described by one or many differential equation, which determines its evolution in time, depending on its *state* and *inputs*.\\\n",
    "Of course you don't want any trajectory, but one that satisfies some desired *constraints* and minimizes a given *performance index*. In addition to this, you may want to add some *boundaries* to your variables, cause that motor of yours cannot exert infinite torque right?\\\n",

    "\n",
    "In optimal control literature, there are many strategies that can be employed to find a solution. Sadly, I don't know them. Also I can't teach (especially you, you're too old).\n",
    "Horizon follows the philosophy behind the direct methods: reducing your optimal control problem to a **nonlinear program (NLP)**.\n",

    "- Direct collocation\n",
    "- Multiple shooting\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these methods, before optimizing, discretize the NLP into a finite dimensional problem: in other words, the horizon of the planning is divided into a given number of nodes. Of course, this means that your optimal input will get discretized as well. If you are ok with that, let's get a little more technical.\n",
